## Introductions: you all

1. On the paper I hand out please write something about yourself (*Do not write something visually apparent like "I have long hair" and do not your name or your major*)

2. Pass your paper back to me

3. Once I pass you a random paper you have 5 minutes to find the person whose paper you have. Write their name and major on the paper

4. We will introduce each other using the paper

## Lab

Let's kick off this class by looking at data and thinking about modeling!

In CI Learn under this week's module there is a [lab-01a.qmd](http://csuci-math430.github.io/lectures/week-01/lab-01a.qmd) file (this is the lab for week 1 lecture a). Please download it and open it in RStudio.
